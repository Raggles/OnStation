On Station is designed to help you keep track of the survey data which you collect while exploring a cave system. It has comprehensive facilities for storing your survey measurements and organizing them in a logical manner.

In addition to its strong storage and retrieval features, On Station has world class drawing capabilities. You are able to draw your cave system and the surrounding surface using a number of different colors and drawing options.

On Station's loop closure capabilites allow you to automatically correct errors in loops (sections of the cave which are reached two different ways). This allows you to use on Station to process your data as a starting point for published maps.

On Station's Query capabilities are unmatched. You can use On Station to show leads, color surveys according to who was on them, and so forth. Anything that you can type as a query using AND and OR terms can be displayed by On Station.
